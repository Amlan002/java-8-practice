What is stream?
A Stream in Java can be defined as a sequence of elements from a source. The source of elements here refers to a Collection or Array that provides data to the Stream.
Java streams are designed in such a way that most of the stream operations (called intermediate operations) return a Stream. This helps to create a chain of stream operations. This is called stream pipe-lining.

Why use stream?
	1.Raise a collection to a stream
	2.Ride the stream: filter values, transform values, limit the output
	3.Compose small individual operations
	4.Collect the result back into a concrete collection
